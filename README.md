[ THINGS TO CONSIDER BEFORE DOWNLOADING MY RECLISTS ]

* I'm NO language expert.
* I specialize mainly in ESPAÃ‘OL (native language) and ENGLISH
* I'm developing my OC world in UTAU, so you might see fictional languages reclists from me (Zapulanne and Chambiul both are created by me).
* Please, PLEASE do NOT claim these as your own, AND contact me (@LoreaMStudios on twitter) if you catch someone stealing them ++.



[ ALLOWED THINGS IN MY RECLISTS ]

* Format conversion (UTF-8 -> ANSI, etc...)
* Edits of any type (oto.ini, reclist itself...etc).
* Voice library creation with these reclists (please do credit me for the reclist so i can see what you made).


[ NOT ALLOWED TO DO ]

* Claiming as own
* Plagiaryzing of any kind
* Redestribution of any kind (i better not see it, please link back to this page)
